i want the predict and update to perform for the measurements which comes for each track (including single measurement or the best report selected for that track using jpda or munkres)
so each measurement should have a corresponding sf and sp not just one 

so do the necessary changes to my code 


now i want to add a option in side the gui in the plotting tab (where i can view plots with respect to the track id 
so it has to show the list of track ids in side with a check box so if i select that check box that specific track id should be plotted on the plot so give me be the full updated code with this integrations


i want proper performace of Munkres algorithm and JPDA im getting same values for both 

so check the process of both algorithms in my code 
check if in munkres proper cost matrix is generated nd proper assignment is given and  calculated on a best report is selected for multiple measurements so it has to pass that best report for update step
and in JPDA check if proper clusters,hypohtesis is generated and probabilities of hypothesis is calculated on a best report is selected for multiple measurements so it has to pass that best report for update step (give me the updated and integrated full code )

integrate to this code and check if its properly adapting and working with the update steps (kalman filter) also 

i want another check box to selct and unslect all tracks at once 


sf value should not start at 0 
so first 2 measurements sf value is calculated and the velocity is computed so 

the plot should have the sf values based on the velocity computation in the plots 

so from 3 sf value it will plot and there should be measurements from 1st one 

so do the changes to my code and updated my code 


this is my main code with i want you to give me just a seperate code for track iniatiation and jpda along with plotting give full updated code
